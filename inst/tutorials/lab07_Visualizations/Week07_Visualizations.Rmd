## Welcome to this new tutorial!

We are already halfway through the course! Pat yourself on the back for the excellent work done!

So far, we have covered several techniques for understanding networks, and we will cover more in the following weeks. Still, sometimes the best analysis is not very much appreciated by your audience if it is difficult to understand.

Imagine that your boss asked you for an overview of network data of interest, and you show up with a pdf file filled with tables and diagrams. It's not gonna fly if your boss has 5 minutes for you, right?

With this tutorial, we will learn how to represent networks in pretty and informative ways so that your analyses will have a greater impact on the intended audience. If you do the job well, the 5 minutes your boss has for you will be more than enough to support your point!

Let's get started with the art of depicting networks!

![](images/cat-painting.jpg){width=75%}


## Pit Stop

As in formula 1, we first quickly make sure you have all the equipment ready for the run!


### R Version 

You need to have installed R version 4.1.1 and this tutorial is going to check it
for you. Please hit the `Run Code` button.

```{r r_check, echo = TRUE, include = TRUE, exercise = TRUE}
check_R()
```


### R Studio Version

You need to have installed RStudio version 1.4.1717 (or above) or 2021.9.0.351 
(or above).
Let's check by clicking `Run Code`:

```{r rstudio_check, echo = TRUE, include = TRUE, exercise = TRUE}
check_RStudio()
```


### Packages

You need to have a few packages installed. 
Click the `Run Code` to check. 
It will check whether you have the required packages installed and will 
attempt to install any missing packages in case there are any (or it will 
advise you to upgrade `SNA4DS`).

```{r package_check, echo = TRUE, include = TRUE, exercise = TRUE}

check_pkgs()

```


And now, take your brushes and colors and get ready to paint!



## Visualizing networks
The visualization of networks is a specific field of data visualization.
In general, we visualize data for several reasons, but one of the most important is to make data and results clear and understandable for a 
larger public. Communicability is an essential skill for academia but also for the private and the public sector. 

You might have very important findings, but if your audience does not
understand them; they are worth nothing. 
A great visualization makes more than half of the job! 
Great visualizations are storytellers!

### Goals of network visualization

* to identify key actors and the relationship between them
* to spot most influential actors
* to check the strength of relationships
* to see whether people belong to sub-groups inside large networks 
* to analyze the structural properties of networks
* to unfold diffusion patterns
* to observe network evolution
* to summaries any relationship among entities in one picture
* ... and many more reasons!

### Software

Several software allow you to do pretty and less pretty network visualizations. Some examples are Gephy, UCInet, Pajek ... 

Of course, we are coders, so we want to be able to do everything by ourselves. Several libraries do the job both in Python and R. Each of them has pros and cons. 

As you might imagine, we move on with `r rproj()` :)


### Basic network plots

Plotting networks is essentially plotting dots and lines. 
The `r rproj()` environment allows us to do it in a relatively easy way.

```{r 07nonNetPlot, echo=TRUE, exercise=TRUE}
x <- 1:10
y1 <- x*x
y2  <- 2*y1
plot(x, y1, type = "b", pch = 19, 
            col = "red", xlab = "x", ylab = "y")
```

However, it isn't easy to represent networks in the `R base` programming language only.

R base does not recognize a network unless you tell it that it is one and does not provide a ready-made environment to plot them.


The `r rproj()` recognizes the class `igraph`. So the package offers a good balance between easy coding and pretty visualizations. Hence in this tutorial, we are going to learn how to use this one. 

Remember, there are also other options out there. 

## Plotting networks in `igraph`

The first ingredient that you absolutely need to plot a network in `igraph` is an `igraph` object!

Hence, either you import your data from a data frame/matrix/edge list, etc., into `igraph`, or make use of an existing `igraph` object, or use the package `intergraph` to change the class of your network to `igraph`. 

When you get to your object of class `igraph`, what do you do? 

Well, surprise, surprise, you plot it with the `plot()` function!

Wanna try? Let's create an Erdos Renyi graph and plot it. 

NOTE: we set a seed since this is a random network generator, and we want to have the same output every time :)

```{r 07randomEs1, echo=TRUE, exercise=TRUE}

set.seed(10000)
igraphNet <- igraph::erdos.renyi.game(10, 2/10)

plot(igraphNet)
```


And it worked! It would be really nice if this simple solution worked all the time. 

Unfortunately, it is not the case.


To plot more complex networks, we need to make our visualization
skills more sophisticated


Let's make a second attempt! We create a second `igraph` network, but this time, larger.

```{r 07randomEs3, echo=TRUE, exercise=TRUE}

set.seed(10001)
igraphNetLarge <- igraph::erdos.renyi.game(1000, 1/1000)


plot(igraphNetLarge)

```


Ouch! I'm blind! What's this blurb! It's just a mess!
This last plot does not meet any of the goal we stated above. 


```{r testquiz, echo = FALSE}
question("What is the main problem with the plots of igraphNet and networkNet?",
    answer("nodes are too small"),
    answer("the colors are not color blind friendly"),
    answer("the plot does not inform us on what the network represents", correct = TRUE)
  )
```

Yes, unless we are working with a toy network, we are not going to tell a story just using 
the `plot()` function with an object of class `igraph`.


### Visualizing the network structure

So, when I said your story, I meant your story properly! The data that we are going to visualize is YOUR dataâ€”the data collected with the survey that we did together in week 4. 

Well, something close to your story, to be honest, since I anonymized it and changed it a bit so that no one can recognize themselves! 

Still, this is your story!



```{r dataload, results = "hide"}

net <- SNA4DSData::DSstudents

# igraph::V(net)$name
# igraph::V(net)$year
# igraph::V(net)$Hang.Out
# igraph::V(net)$gender
# igraph::E(net)$frequency
# igraph::E(net)$closeness


```


Let's briefly explore the network.
```{r datacheck07, echo=TRUE, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup ="dataload"}

summary(net)

```

We have 

* network level: with 81 nodes and 150 edges -directed network (since respondents named alters filling out the survey)

* node level: 4 nodes attributes 
* edge level: 2 edge attributes 

Let's make sure it is anonymous.  

```{r datacheck1, echo=TRUE, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup ="dataload"}
igraph::V(net)$name
```

We have 81 of you in there. From student 1 to 81. Who knows who you are? (Ahah... me! Evil laugh!)


Ok, let's get serious! Let's plot an overview of the network-level information.

```{r plot107, echo=TRUE, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup ="dataload"}
plot(net) 
```


We can do better than this, simply improving the graphics a little.

Simply plot it, reducing the vertexes and the size of the arrow, removing the vertex label, and curving the edges a little, to make them more artistic.


```{r plot207, echo=TRUE, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup ="dataload"}
plot(net, 
     vertex.size = 5,
     edge.arrow.size = .4, 
     vertex.label = NA, 
     edge.curved = .1)
```


Better right? Just playing around with these options, we achieved a much clearer output. 
Now we actually see the groups and the relationships clearly.

Still, we can do better! So let's do it, together with some aesthetic improvements!

```{r plot307, echo=TRUE, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup ="dataload"}
plot(net, 
     vertex.size = 7,
     edge.arrow.size = .2, 
     vertex.label = igraph::V(net)$name, 
     edge.curved = .1,
     vertex.label.cex = 0.6,  # vertex label size
     vertex.label.color = "black", 
     edge.color = "blue",
     vertex.color = "orange", 
     vertex.frame.color = "green") # node perimeter
```

How do you like this one? Can you figure out which line of code does what?

It indeed looks fancier, but it is still not telling us a lot about what happens in your group!


Let's make use of the attributes!

### Visualizing node attributes 


We have more information on this network. Let's try to show it.

One easy way is to plot a node attribute as the color of the node or as the label of the nodes.

For instance, we can plot:

* the students belonging to years 1, 2, and 3 in three different colors.
* the gender on the label

NOTE: these are both categorical variables.


```{r plot4, echo=TRUE, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup ="dataload"}


plot(net,
     edge.arrow.size = .2, 
     edge.color = "gray80",
     vertex.frame.color = "#ffffff",#node perimeter
     vertex.label = igraph::V(net)$gender, 
     vertex.label.cex = 0.6,  # vertex label size
     vertex.label.color = "black",
     vertex.color = igraph::V(net)$year
) 

```



With this visualization, we can already see whether the year and the gender matter in forming friendship!


What do you think?

```{r quiz_viz1, echo = FALSE}
quiz(
  question("How do you interpret this visualization?",
    answer("The year matters for friednship formation but the gender does not"),
    answer("Both matter, but since there are many more males the year is a better predictor of friendship", correct = TRUE),
    answer("The year does not matter for friednship formation but the gender does"),
    answer("Both the year and the gender equally matter in predicting friendship"),
    correct = "Yes! Well done!",
    random_answer_order = TRUE,
    allow_retry = TRUE
  )
)
```



We can also show a third node attribute at the same time: "How much students like data science." 

According to how much each of the respondents likes data science, the size of the node changes. 





```{r twoAttributes, echo=TRUE, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup ="dataload"}


plot(net,
     edge.arrow.size = .2, 
     edge.color = "gray80",
     vertex.frame.color = "#ffffff",#node perimeter
     vertex.label = igraph::V(net)$gender, 
     vertex.label.cex = 0.6,  # vertex label size
     vertex.label.color = "black", 
     vertex.color = igraph::V(net)$year,
     vertex.size = igraph::V(net)$DS*2
     
) 



```


Pay attention: since the simple numeric variable expressing Data Science likelihood would plot nodes of tiny size, I added `*2` to multiply the coefficient by two and increase the size. It's a helpful trick. 


Can you plot the same network with Hang-Out as node size instead of Data Science? Can you also increase the size by 3 for me? 

```{r tut07_04, echo=TRUE, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup ="dataload"}




```




```{r tut07_04-solution}



plot(net,
     edge.arrow.size = .2, 
     edge.color = "gray80",
     vertex.frame.color = "#ffffff",#node perimeter
     vertex.label = igraph::V(net)$gender, 
     vertex.label.cex = 0.6,  # vertex label size
     vertex.label.color = "black", 
     vertex.color = igraph::V(net)$year,
     vertex.size = igraph::V(net)$Hang.Out*3
) 



```

```{r tut07_04-check}
gradethis::grade_code(correct = "Great job! I knew that you could do it!")
```



Another common and helpful way to show a node attribute on a plot is to show different shades of the same color to show how the "intensity" of an attribute increases. 
Obviously, this makes sense with ordinal variables only. So let's try with `Hang.Out`. 

We know it ranges from 1 never hanging out with friends to 5 hanging out every day.

We prepare a new variable with the color before inserting it into the plot so we can manually assign the colors since random ones won't do the trick. We then move on to plotting, and finally, we add a legend. 


```{r twoAttributes07, echo=TRUE, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup ="dataload"}

# check the variable first
table(igraph::V(net)$Hang.Out)
class(igraph::V(net)$Hang.Out)

# Generate colors based on year:
colrs <- c("cadetblue", "dodgerblue", "dodgerblue3", "blue", "darkblue" )
# create a new attribute with the color
igraph::V(net)$color <- colrs[igraph::V(net)$Hang.Out] # we attribute each year to a color


plot(net,
     edge.arrow.size = .2, 
     edge.color = "gray80",
     vertex.frame.color = "#ffffff",#node perimeter
     vertex.label = igraph::V(net)$gender, 
     vertex.label.cex = 0.6,  # vertex label size
     vertex.label.color = "black", 
     vertex.size = igraph::V(net)$DS*2,
) 
graphics::legend(x = -1.5, y = -1.1, c("Never","Once per week", "Two or three times", "Four or five times", "Every day"), pch = 21,
                 col = "#777777", pt.bg = colrs, pt.cex = 2, cex = .8, bty = "n", ncol = 1)


```

Nice uh?! But now it's time to move on to edge attributes!

### Visualizing Edge Attributes

Ok, in this case, we don't care about the label, and we set it to NA, so it disappears.
We also don't care about showing a node attribute with the color since we want to use colors to show the edge attribute instead. Too many colors are confusing. 

We access the edge attribute with the `E()` function in `igraph`. As in `igraph::E(net)$edge_attribute`. 
It's the same as the `V()` function for accessing vertex attributes. 

Suppose we only want to show that these friendships have different frequencies. In that case, we can set the edge attribute as the edge color, and random colors will be plotted characterizing different relationships. 

```{r edgeAttr1, echo=TRUE, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup ="dataload"}


plot(net,
     edge.arrow.size = .2, 
     edge.color = igraph::E(net)$frequency,
     vertex.frame.color = "#ffffff",#node perimeter
     vertex.label = NA, 
     vertex.color = "grey",
     vertex.size = igraph::V(net)$Hang.Out*3
)



```


It worked, but this is not very informative. You can make a color scale as we did for the node, or you can plot the attribute as the thickness of the edge. 

Let's try using the parameter `edge.width` and showing the remaining variable "closeness"!

```{r edgeAttr2, echo=TRUE, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup ="dataload"}


plot(net,
     edge.arrow.size = .2, 
     edge.color = igraph::E(net)$frequency,
     vertex.frame.color = "#ffffff",#node perimeter
     vertex.label = NA, 
     vertex.color = "grey",
     vertex.size = igraph::V(net)$Hang.Out*3, 
     edge.width = igraph::E(net)$closeness*2
)
```



That worked! Isn't it lovely? ^_^


### Layout

For a small network like the one we are analyzing now (81 nodes, 150 edges), you can plot a readable graph without too much effort. However, when you increase the size or plot many attributes at once, you might feel the need to try different solutions for optimally positioning your nodes to increase the readability. 

The position of the node is obviously handled by an algorithm that we call `layout`.

The default option that is already set for you in `igraph` is called `layout_nicely`.

Run the plot below and check the output. 





```{r plot076, echo=TRUE, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup ="dataload"}

plot(net,
     edge.arrow.size = .2, 
     edge.color = igraph::E(net)$frequency,
     vertex.frame.color = "#ffffff",#node perimeter
     vertex.label = NA, 
     vertex.color = "grey",
     vertex.size = igraph::V(net)$Hang.Out*3, 
     edge.width = igraph::E(net)$closeness*2 ,
     layout = igraph::layout_nicely
     
)


```


Even if it is exactly the same plot we ran in the code box before, it is slightly different since we did not set a seed. Still, you can see it looks very similar.

Network layouts are simply algorithms that return coordinates for each node in a network.
We can improve the look of our visualization by setting some layout options that we believe work best with our data.

Let's explore a few more!

```{r plot707, echo=TRUE, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup ="dataload"}

plot(net,
     edge.arrow.size = .2, 
     edge.color = igraph::E(net)$frequency,
     vertex.frame.color = "#ffffff",#node perimeter
     vertex.label = NA, 
     vertex.color = "grey",
     vertex.size = igraph::V(net)$Hang.Out*3, 
     edge.width = igraph::E(net)$closeness*2,
     layout = igraph::layout_on_sphere
     
)
```


This one represents it as a sphere. LOL, it's funny but really not helpful in showing any idea!

Let's try another one.


```{r plot80799, echo=TRUE, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup ="dataload"}

plot(net,
     edge.arrow.size = .2, 
     edge.color = igraph::E(net)$frequency,
     vertex.frame.color = "#ffffff",#node perimeter
     vertex.label = NA, 
     vertex.color = "grey",
     vertex.size = igraph::V(net)$Hang.Out*3, 
     edge.width = igraph::E(net)$closeness*2,
     layout = igraph::layout_as_tree
     
)
```


Ok, also funny, but no. Seriously, no. 

Let's try something useful now. Would you please try the `layout.fruchterman.reingold` for me?


```{r plot807, echo=TRUE, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup ="dataload"}

plot(net,
     edge.arrow.size = .2, 
     edge.color = igraph::E(net)$frequency,
     vertex.frame.color = "#ffffff",#node perimeter
     vertex.label = NA, 
     vertex.color = "grey",
     vertex.size = igraph::V(net)$Hang.Out*3, 
     edge.width = igraph::E(net)$closeness*2,
     layout = igraph::layout.random
     
)
```

The `layout.fruchterman.reingold` is one of the gold standards of plotting networks! 



Look up these algorithms in the help files! There are many, and you can find the perfect one for what you need!


## Conclusive Remarks

In this tutorial, we sow an overview of the most useful techniques to plot networks in `igraph`. Obviously, there are many more tricks, and we will see some others during the lab. 

Still, the most important thing to remember is that what matters is that you know which story you want to tell with your visualization, and you make sure it shows in the plot. 

Needless to say, making good visualizations takes plenty of time, and to a
certain extent, it is an art! So try to express your creativity and to have fun when you do it! 

Let's say goodbye with the visualization of someone that knew how to tell (funny) stories and after whom our school is named :)
